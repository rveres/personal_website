Hey there! Welcome to my slice of the interwebs.

I'm Robert Veres, a high school student in Charlotte, North Carolina. I write code for websites; mobile apps; and low-level system architectures in more than a few programming languages, find out cool things from data, and help others learn how to code. But don't be fooled--I'm not just a programmer. I *love* biology and math and am always learning something new (in fact, I just recently got interested in watercolor painting).

Beyond those things, I'm also Hungarian. And a vegetarian. And run 5Ks. And an (amateur) [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152383209@N08/). And am deeply involved in international affairs. (Phew.)
