Welcome to my slice of the internet.

I'm Robert Veres, a student pursuing of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. Currently, I'm working as a machine learning engineer in Japan. I write code for websites; mobile apps; and low-level system architectures, extract meaning from data, and tinker with electronics. I also *love* biology, math, and finance and am always learning something new.

Beyond those things, I'm also Hungarian. And love to dance salsa. And run 5Ks. And an (amateur) [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152383209@N08/). And am deeply interested in international affairs, both past and present. (Phew.)

## Robert, the programmer...and then some
Here's a little more about what I do:
* **Backend Web Development** with a variety of platforms and databases
* **Frontend Web Development** in most of the popular frameworks
* **Mobile Development** on Android and iOS with Flutter and React Native
* **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning** using Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
* **Data Engineering** with the Apache suite: Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and Flink
* **Cloud Engineering** with Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services
* **Low-Level Programming** in C for UNIX and Intel architectures
* **Electronics** prototyping and Printed Circuit Board development in Altium
* **Quantitative Finance** and **Supply Chain Analysis** with tools such as the Bloomberg Terminal and Panjiva from S&P Global

How did I learn all of this? Simply put, I love learning. I'm always looking for new courses to take and books to read.

## What am I up to now?
At the moment, I'm working as a machine learning engineer in NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Japan.

After Japan, I'm hoping to work as a software/data/machine learning/hardware engineer in Europe. I fundamentally believe that gaining international work experience is a must in this globally interconnected world.
