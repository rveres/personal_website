Welcome to my slice of the internet.

I'm Robert Veres, a freshman at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. I write code for websites; mobile apps; and low-level system architectures in more than a few programming languages, find out cool things from data, and help others learn how to code. But don't be fooled--I'm not just a programmer. I *love* biology and math and am always learning something new.

Beyond those things, I'm also Hungarian. And a vegetarian. And run 5Ks. And an (amateur) [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152383209@N08/). And am deeply interested in international affairs, both past and present. (Phew.)

*That's me!*

## Robert, the programmer
Here's a little more about what I do:
* **Backend Web Development** with a variety of platforms and databases
* **Frontend Web Development** in most of the popular frameworks
* **Mobile Development** on Android and iOS with Flutter and React Native
* **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning** using Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow, and Keras
* **Data Engineering** with the Apache suite: Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and Flink
* **Cloud Engineering** with Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services
* **Low-Level Programming** in C for UNIX and Intel architectures

## What am I up to now?
Well, the answer to that question is changing. Constantly. To check out what I'm working on right now, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/thedeveloper733) page.
