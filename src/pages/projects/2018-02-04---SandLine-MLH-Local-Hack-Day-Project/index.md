description: "My project for the Major League Hacking Local Hack Day. This website allows students to select and customize the sandwich they want to purchase from the cafeteria, which is then displayed to cafeteria administrators in a portal that requires authorization. The front-end functionality--including reactive forms, dynamic tables, and custom data hashing--is implemented with an Angular single-page application that consumes a Loopback backend API."
